### Hi there 👋 My name is Sophia!

I am an astronomer based in the US. My scientific research focuses on understanding the nebulae in galaxies both 
nearby and (sometimes _very_) far away using spectroscopy of light emitted in the UV, visible, and infrared. 
I also spend a lot of time developing code for various modeling and statistical analyses for my research. For more
about me, check out [my website](https://sflury.github.io).

Below are several repositories of code I've released publicly for various scientific applications. They include
statistics ([feldcous](https://www.github.com/sflury/feldcous), [histogram](https://www.github.com/sflury/histogram),
[kendall](https://www.github.com/sflury/kendall)) and modeling ([OutLines](https://www.github.com/sflury/OutLines), 
[redneb](https://www.github.com/sflury/redneb)).
