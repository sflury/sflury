### Hi there 👋 My name is Sophia!

I am an astronomer based in the US. My scientific research focuses on understanding the nebulae in galaxies both 
nearby and (sometimes _very_) far away using spectroscopy of light emitted in the UV, visible, and infrared. 
I also spend a lot of time developing code for various modeling and statistical analyses for my research. For more
about me, check out [my website](https://sflury.github.io).

Below are several repositories of code I've released publicly for various scientific applications. They include
statistics ([feldcous](https://www.github.com/sflury/feldcous), [histogram](https://www.github.com/sflury/histogram),
[kendall](https://www.github.com/sflury/kendall), [LinRegConf](https://github.com/sflury/LinRegConf)), 
modeling ([OutLines](https://www.github.com/sflury/OutLines), [redneb](https://www.github.com/sflury/redneb)), and
combinations of the two ([LyCsurv](https://github.com/sflury/LyCsurv)).

### Highlighted Repository: [OutLines](https://www.github.com/sflury/OutLines)

This code calculates model emission and absorption line profiles based on the physics of stellar winds and galactic
outflows. The basic premise is illustrated with this (highly simplistic) cartoon where the light green gas emits
light and the dark green gas emits _and_ absorbs light. All the gas is moving with some momentum based on how far
away that gas is from the source of its momentum. The motion of the gas causes a _Doppler shift_ in the light 
absorbed or emitted by the gas, indicated by the color of the arrows. As a result, the motion of the gas and the 
amount of gas at each Doppler shift produce a unique signature in the light we ultimately observe.  <br><br>

An example of the light we might see is the the O VI P Cygni feature in the far ultraviolet, as shown here, where
the dips correspond to the absorbing gas (the dark green region) and the spikes correspond to the emitting gas
(light and dark green regions). We see the spikes and dips together, which makes them combine to "cancel out"
in some places but not others. My code models both the spikes and the dips in order to predict the total profile.
